Used this tutorial: 
https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular

Exceptions: For the time being, I used local hosted version of mongodb rather than the service used in the tutorial. 

As a result, I downloaded and started mongo services and pointed the server.js file to mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/roommate')
Instructions for installing/running Mongodb service:
